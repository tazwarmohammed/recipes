    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A burger is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, 
        typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with 
        cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilies; condiments such as ketchup, 
        mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce," often a variation of Thousand Island 
        dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns.</p>
    <p>The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the 
        United Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used or can even refer to ground beef. 
        Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with 
        the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, or veggie burger. In Australia and New Zealand, a piece of chicken breast 
        on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which would generally not be considered to be a burger 
        in the United States; Americans would generally call it a chicken sandwich, but in 
        Australian English and New Zealand English a sandwich requires sliced bread (not a bun), 
        so it would not be considered a sandwich.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground lean (7% fat) beef</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>¼ cup fine dried bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire</li>
        <li>1 or 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>About 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>About 1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns (4 in. wide), split</li>
        <li>About 1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>About 1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>4 iceberg lettuce leaves, rinsed and crisped</li>
        <li>1 firm-ripe tomato, cored and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 thin slices red onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.</li>
        <li>Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.</li>
